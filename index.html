          Martin, Carol, Claire, Kyle, Michelle, and Drew have created the Ranly Education Fund. The fund is available for Ranly family members who want/need some financial assistance for their post secondary education.
          <br><br>
          The fund will continue giving benefits until it runs out of money or until Claire and Michelle are no longer with us. Below are further details.
